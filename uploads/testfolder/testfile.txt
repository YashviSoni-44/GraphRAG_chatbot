GraphRAG is a method that combines knowledge graphs with retrieval-augmented generation to improve question answering. 
It extracts facts and relationships from documents and stores them as nodes and edges. 
Then, when a user asks a question, it queries the graph for relevant context before sending it to an LLM.

For example, if a document contains sentences about AI, machine learning, and deep learning, GraphRAG can organize them into a structured format. 
This makes it easier to retrieve specific information and generate more accurate answers.

Neo4j is commonly used as the graph database because of its support for Cypher query language. 
Groq and Mistral are LLM providers that can be integrated with GraphRAG to produce high-quality responses.
